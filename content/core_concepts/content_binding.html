        Data Binding is a core concept within every MVC based framework, so for sure it is also part of The M-Project.
        We use Data Binding to automatically update views, whenever a property they observe changes. To achieve that,
        we implemented the observer pattern as shown in simplified the UML diagram below.

    <p class="text">
        To begin understanding the concept behind the Data Binding, let's take a look at a simple example app.
        Imagine you've got two textfield on your screen. You click into the first one - the master, begin to type
        and want the second one - the slave - to display exactly the same text. The figure below shows how this
        could look like.
    </p>

    <div class="screens">
        <img src="images/core_concepts/screen_content_binding2.png" alt="Content Binding" />
    </div>

    <p class="text">
        How does this work? How does the first textfield tell the second one that it's content changed? Do they
        communicate directly at all? If you take a look at the observer pattern UML diagram above, you will see that
        they don't. Instead there is a "central instance", an M.Observable, that knows that the second textfield observes
        a property that is again set by the first textfield. This "central instance" is realised as a property of the
        corresponding controller to our views. The following sequence diagram illustrates this process of changing the
        value inside the first textfield and delegating these changes right to the second textfield.

<!-- HOWTO1 -->
<div class="contentBasics">
    <a name="howto1"><h2 class="line">How to set up content binding?</h2></a>

    <p class="text">
        Setting up the content binding for a view element is pretty convenient. You simply assign a scope and a property,
        that is available at this scope. The following code snippet shows how to do this, using the example of a label view.
    </p>
<pre class="syntax javascript">
M.LabelView.design({
    contentBinding: {
        target: MyApplication.MyController,
        property: 'myProperty'
    }
});</pre>
    <p class="text">
        As you can see you use the <span class="code">contentBinding</span> property and pass an object, consisting of
        <span class="code">target</span> and <span class="code">property</span>. While <span class="code">target</span>
        specifies the scope (as an object) for the content binding, <span class="code">target</span> (as a string) defines
        the name of a property within this scope. This property is what the view gets bound to.
    </p>

    <span class="navlink" onclick="scroll('top')">&uarr; top</span>
</div>
<!-- END OF HOWTO1 -->

<!-- HOWTO2 -->
<div class="contentBasics">
    <a name="howto2"><h2 class="line">How to trigger content update?</h2></a>

    <p class="text">
        Once you're set up, you can change the bound content and the view will update itself automatically. How do you
        do this? It's pretty easy: Use the <span class="code">set</span> method of <span class="code">M.Controller</span>.
        This will trigger the <span class="code">contentDidChange</span> method (c.p. observer pattern). The following source
        code shows how to do this with a label like shown in the section above.
    </p>
<pre class="syntax javascript">
/* This is the responsible controller */
MyApplication.MyController = M.Controller.extend({

    /* This is the bound property */
    myProperty: null,

    /* This is an arbitrary function that will trigger the content update */
    myFunction: function() {
        this.set('myProperty', 'I am the new value!');
    }
});</pre>
    <p class="text">
        By calling the controller's <span class="code">set</span> method, mainly three things happen:
        <ol>
            <li>
                The property <span class="code">myProperty</span> get the value <span class="code">'I am the new value!'</span>.
            </li>
            <li>
                The value of the label view gets set to exactly this value (<span class="code">'I am the new value!'</span>).
            </li>
            <li>
                The <span class="code">contentDidChange</span> method of the label view gets called, to make the view update its representation.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <span class="navlink" onclick="scroll('top')">&uarr; top</span>
